# Draw It
This is a simple HTML5 JavaScript game I developed. It's very basic but is enjoyable with friends.

The game is called Draw It because it's a game where you can draw whatever you want for everyone to see. It's a live web-socket based game so what you paint is what everyone else sees. This project required the use of a Node.js websocket implementation.

# Controls
Use left click to draw.
Mouse scroll to increase or decrease brush size.
Select with colour picker wheel to change brush colour.
